## Documentation Created
We've created a comprehensive AI instruction file (.agent.md) that includes:
1. Project overview and structure
2. Styling architecture and design patterns
3. Component dependencies and relationships
4. Development workflow and GitHub Pages deployment
5. Guidelines for adding new pages and blog posts
6. Best practices for code maintenance
7. Potential future enhancements
8. Accessibility and SEO considerations

## Improvements Made
1. Updated the README.md with project-specific information
2. Created a detailed AI instruction guide for future development
3. Documented the process for adding new content (pages and blog posts)
4. Outlined best practices for maintaining the codebase

## Next Steps
The website is well-structured but could benefit from:
1. Adding a contact form instead of mailto links
2. Implementing more interactive elements to showcase the virtual lab capabilities
3. Adding code splitting for performance optimization
4. Implementing unit tests for components
5. Adding more blog content to enhance SEO

The AI instruction file will serve as a valuable resource for future development, ensuring consistency and maintainability as the website evolves.
