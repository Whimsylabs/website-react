Research demonstrates that such interactive, three-dimensional learning environments significantly improve spatial understanding and long-term retention compared to traditional textbook-based approaches (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ase.1465" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lewis et al., 2014</a>).</p><div class="preview-fade"></div></div><span class="read-more-link">Read More</span></div></a><a href="/blog/virtual-kidney-dissection-send-engagement/" class="blog-preview-link"><div class="post-box post-preview" id="post-virtual-kidney-dissection-send-engagement"><div class="post-header-image"><img src="/images/kidney_barclays.jpg" alt="Participants engaging with the WhimsyLabs kidney dissection at Barclays Headquarters"/></div><h2><span class="post-title">Hands-On Learning: Virtual Kidney Dissection Enhances SEND Student Engagement</span></h2><span class="post-date">19 March 2025</span><div class="post-preview-content"><p>The human kidney plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis—filtering blood, balancing fluids and electrolytes, and removing waste.

Yet for many, the complexity of its internal structures can make it difficult to fully grasp how it functions. Our recent WhimsyLabs demonstration tackled this challenge by recreating a full kidney dissection in a virtual reality environment, complete with physically interactive dissection tools and a functioning microscope simulation.</p><p>Unlike conventional VR labs that guide students passively through a process, this experience puts them in control. Participants physically manipulate lab tools using natural hand gestures, make incisions in virtual tissue, and examine microscopic anatomy through detailed zoom functions.

Most existing virtual lab solutions act as glorified animations or guided walkthroughs, restricting students to predetermined steps rather than allowing them to experiment freely. Research indicates that traditional computer-based simulations often fail to engage students meaningfully, as they lack the authentic decision-making and problem-solving experiences of real laboratory work (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/tea.21074" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">de Jong et al., 2013</a>).</p><p><a href="https://whimsylabs.ai">Whimsylabs</a> takes a radically different approach. We have built the first fully interactive, physics-driven virtual laboratory, where students do not merely watch or follow instructions—they perform real procedures, manipulate tools as they would in a physical lab, and even experience the consequences of incorrect technique. This crucial innovation introduces the ability to train true muscle memory, ensuring that students develop procedural fluency and confidence before they even step into a real-world lab. Studies in motor skill acquisition demonstrate that virtual practice can effectively transfer to real-world performance when the virtual environment maintains high levels of physical fidelity (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1541931213601477" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sigrist et al., 2013</a>).</p><div class="preview-fade"></div></div><span class="read-more-link">Read More</span></div></a><a href="/blog/whimsylabs-education-revolution/" class="blog-preview-link"><div class="post-box post-preview" id="post-whimsylabs-education-revolution"><div class="post-header-image"><img src="/images/oldLab.png" alt="First mockup lab"/></div><h2><span class="post-title">A Brief History of Whimsylabs: From our Humble Start to a BETT 2025 Winner </span></h2><span class="post-date">27 January 2025</span><div class="post-preview-content"><p>Whimsylabs was initially started in 2020 by Marisa French towards the end of her Physics PhD, right as the pandemic was beginning to hit. The devastating impact of COVID-19, which shuttered traditional lab environments, left many students without access to hands-on science education for years (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0905-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grewenig et al., 2021</a>). This coupled with the UK&#x27;s declining STEM rankings—with the UK dropping to 27th place in the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) science rankings (<a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/pisa-2022-results-volume-i_53f23881-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OECD, 2023</a>)—highlighted a crisis for British education that felt personal, as Marisa had been inspired to pursue science due to the practicals she had experienced in secondary school.</p><p>Driven by a desire to create meaningful change, Marisa leveraged her simulation and gaming skills to develop a fully simulated sandbox virtual laboratory. Research demonstrates that simulation-based learning environments can significantly improve student engagement and learning outcomes, particularly in STEM fields where hands-on experimentation is crucial (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131520302426" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rutten et al., 2012</a>). This lab was designed to be a safe, accessible, and engaging environment for hands-on learning, without the risks or costs associated with traditional labs. The goal was simple; make a virtual lab that fully captured the fun that she experienced in her school labs, and that could be used by anyone, anywhere, at any time.</p><div class="preview-fade"></div></div><span class="read-more-link">Read More</span></div></a></div><div class="sidebar"><h2>Blog Posts</h2><ul><li class=""><a href="/blog/sandbox-learning-revolution-stem-education/">The Sandbox Learning Revolution: Why Freedom to Fail is Essential for STEM Education</a></li><li class=""><a href="/blog/whimsycat-ai-tutor-transforming-science-education/">Meet WhimsyCat: The Revolutionary AI Tutor Transforming Science Education</a></li><li class=""><a href="/blog/ai-powered-virtual-labs-solving-education-crisis/">Revolutionizing STEM Education: How WhimsyLabs&#x27; AI-Powered Virtual Labs Are Solving the Global Science Education Crisis</a></li><li class=""><a href="/blog/virtual-kidney-dissection-send-engagement/">Hands-On Learning: Virtual Kidney Dissection Enhances SEND Student Engagement</a></li><li class=""><a href="/blog/physicality-in-virtual-labs/">The Importance of Physicality in Virtual Labs: A Step Beyond Traditional Simulations</a></li><li class=""><a href="/blog/whimsylabs-education-revolution/">A Brief History of Whimsylabs: From our Humble Start to a BETT 2025 Winner </a></li></ul></div></div></div></section><footer class="footer-container" aria-labelledby="footer-heading"><p>© 2025 Whimsylabs – Virtual Laboratory Solutions</p><ul class="footer-links" aria-label="Footer navigation"><li><a href="/" class="nav-link" aria-label="Navigate to Home">Home</a></li><li><a href="/services/" class="nav-link" aria-label="View Our Services">Services</a></li><li><a href="/contact/" class="nav-link" aria-label="Contact Us via Email">Contact</a></li><li><a href="/blog/" class="nav-link" aria-label="Visit Our Blog">Blog</a></li><li><a href="/faq/" class="nav-link" aria-label="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</a></li></ul><div class="social-icons"><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/whimsylabs.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Visit our Bluesky profile"><img src="/images/blueskylogosmall.png" alt="Bluesky logo" class="social-icon"/></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@whimsylabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Visit our YouTube channel"><img src="/images/youtube-iconsmalll.png" alt="YouTube logo" class="social-icon"/></a></div></footer></main>

We have built the first fully interactive, physics-driven virtual laboratory, where students do not merely watch or follow instructions—they perform real procedures, manipulate tools as they would in a physical lab, and even experience the consequences of incorrect technique. This crucial innovation introduces the ability to train true muscle memory, ensuring that students develop procedural fluency and confidence before they even step into a real-world lab. Studies in motor skill acquisition demonstrate that virtual practice can effectively transfer to real-world performance when the virtual environment maintains high levels of physical fidelity (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1541931213601477" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sigrist et al., 2013</a>).</p><div class="preview-fade"></div></div><span class="read-more-link">Read More</span></div></a><a href="/blog/whimsylabs-education-revolution/" class="blog-preview-link"><div class="post-box post-preview" id="post-whimsylabs-education-revolution"><div class="post-header-image"><img src="/images/oldLab.png" alt="First mockup lab"/></div><h2><span class="post-title">A Brief History of Whimsylabs: From our Humble Start to a BETT 2025 Winner </span></h2><span class="post-date">27 January 2025</span><div class="post-preview-content"><p>Whimsylabs was initially started in 2020 by Marisa French towards the end of her Physics PhD, right as the pandemic was beginning to hit. The devastating impact of COVID-19, which shuttered traditional lab environments, left many students without access to hands-on science education for years (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0905-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grewenig et al., 2021</a>). This coupled with the UK&#x27;s declining STEM rankings—with the UK dropping to 27th place in the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) science rankings (<a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/pisa-2022-results-volume-i_53f23881-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OECD, 2023</a>)—highlighted a crisis for British education that felt personal, as Marisa had been inspired to pursue science due to the practicals she had experienced in secondary school.</p><p>Driven by a desire to create meaningful change, Marisa leveraged her simulation and gaming skills to develop a fully simulated sandbox virtual laboratory. Research demonstrates that simulation-based learning environments can significantly improve student engagement and learning outcomes, particularly in STEM fields where hands-on experimentation is crucial (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131520302426" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rutten et al., 2012</a>). This lab was designed to be a safe, accessible, and engaging environment for hands-on learning, without the risks or costs associated with traditional labs. The goal was simple; make a virtual lab that fully captured the fun that she experienced in her school labs, and that could be used by anyone, anywhere, at any time.</p><div class="preview-fade"></div></div><span class="read-more-link">Read More</span></div></a></div><div class="sidebar"><h2>Blog Posts</h2><ul><li class=""><a href="/blog/sandbox-learning-revolution-stem-education/">The Sandbox Learning Revolution: Why Freedom to Fail is Essential for STEM Education</a></li><li class=""><a href="/blog/whimsycat-ai-tutor-transforming-science-education/">Meet WhimsyCat: The Revolutionary AI Tutor Transforming Science Education</a></li><li class=""><a href="/blog/ai-powered-virtual-labs-solving-education-crisis/">Revolutionizing STEM Education: How WhimsyLabs&#x27; AI-Powered Virtual Labs Are Solving the Global Science Education Crisis</a></li><li class=""><a href="/blog/virtual-kidney-dissection-send-engagement/">Hands-On Learning: Virtual Kidney Dissection Enhances SEND Student Engagement</a></li><li class=""><a href="/blog/physicality-in-virtual-labs/">The Importance of Physicality in Virtual Labs: A Step Beyond Traditional Simulations</a></li><li class=""><a href="/blog/whimsylabs-education-revolution/">A Brief History of Whimsylabs: From our Humble Start to a BETT 2025 Winner </a></li></ul></div></div></div></section><footer class="footer-container" aria-labelledby="footer-heading"><p>© 2025 Whimsylabs – Virtual Laboratory Solutions</p><ul class="footer-links" aria-label="Footer navigation"><li><a href="/" class="nav-link" aria-label="Navigate to Home">Home</a></li><li><a href="/services/" class="nav-link" aria-label="View Our Services">Services</a></li><li><a href="/contact/" class="nav-link" aria-label="Contact Us via Email">Contact</a></li><li><a href="/blog/" class="nav-link" aria-label="Visit Our Blog">Blog</a></li><li><a href="/faq/" class="nav-link" aria-label="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</a></li></ul><div class="social-icons"><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/whimsylabs.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Visit our Bluesky profile"><img src="/images/blueskylogosmall.png" alt="Bluesky logo" class="social-icon"/></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@whimsylabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Visit our YouTube channel"><img src="/images/youtube-iconsmalll.png" alt="YouTube logo" class="social-icon"/></a></div></footer></main></div>
