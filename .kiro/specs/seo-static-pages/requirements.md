# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The WhimsyLabs website currently has a React SPA that provides an excellent user experience, but the static HTML pages generated for SEO purposes look completely different from the React version. This creates a poor user experience when users land on static pages from search engines or when JavaScript is disabled. The feature will ensure that static pages match the React SPA's appearance and functionality while maintaining SEO benefits.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a search engine crawler, I want to access static HTML pages that contain the same content and structure as the React SPA, so that I can properly index the website content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a search engine crawler accesses any page THEN the system SHALL serve static HTML with complete content matching the React SPA
2. WHEN static HTML is generated THEN the system SHALL include all meta tags, structured data, and SEO elements present in the React version
3. WHEN static pages are created THEN the system SHALL maintain the same URL structure as the React SPA routes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user landing on a static page from search results, I want the page to look and feel identical to the React SPA version, so that I have a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits a static page THEN the system SHALL display the same visual styling as the React SPA
2. WHEN static pages load THEN the system SHALL include all CSS styles and layout components from the React build
3. WHEN JavaScript loads on a static page THEN the system SHALL seamlessly transition to the React SPA without visual changes
4. WHEN a user interacts with a static page THEN the system SHALL provide the same interactive elements as the React version

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the website, I want the static page generation to automatically sync with React component changes, so that I don't need to manually update static content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React components are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically reflect those changes in static pages during build
2. WHEN new routes are added to React Router THEN the system SHALL automatically generate corresponding static pages
3. WHEN blog posts are added or modified THEN the system SHALL automatically update static blog pages and listings
4. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL generate static pages that use the same components and data as the React SPA

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with JavaScript disabled, I want to access functional static pages with basic navigation and content, so that I can still use the website effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript is disabled THEN the system SHALL display static pages with readable content and basic navigation
2. WHEN users navigate between static pages without JavaScript THEN the system SHALL provide working links to all main sections
3. WHEN static pages are accessed without JavaScript THEN the system SHALL include fallback content that represents the core functionality
4. WHEN forms are present on static pages THEN the system SHALL provide basic form functionality without JavaScript dependencies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want the static pages to maintain fast loading times and optimal performance, so that users have a good experience regardless of how they access the site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN static pages are generated THEN the system SHALL optimize CSS and JavaScript loading for performance
2. WHEN users access static pages THEN the system SHALL serve pre-rendered content without requiring client-side rendering delays
3. WHEN static assets are included THEN the system SHALL properly reference and include all necessary CSS, JavaScript, and image files
4. WHEN the build process completes THEN the system SHALL generate static pages that pass Core Web Vitals metrics
