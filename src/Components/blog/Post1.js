      Whimsylabs was initially started in 2020 by Marisa French towards the end
      of her Physics PhD, right as the pandemic was beginning to hit. The
      devastating impact of COVID-19, which shuttered traditional lab
      environments, left many students without access to hands-on science
      education for years (

      ). This coupled with the UK's declining STEM rankings, with the UK dropping
      to 15th place in the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment
      (PISA) science rankings (
      <a
        href="https://www.oecd.org/publication/pisa-2022-results/"

      ), highlighted a crisis for British education that felt personal, as Marisa
      had been inspired to pursue science due to the practicals she had
      experienced in secondary school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Driven by a desire to create meaningful change, Marisa leveraged her
      simulation and gaming skills to develop a fully simulated sandbox virtual
      laboratory. Research demonstrates that simulation-based learning
      environments can significantly improve student engagement and learning
      outcomes, particularly in STEM fields where hands-on experimentation is
      crucial (
      <a

      >

      ). This lab was designed to be a safe, accessible, and engaging
      environment for hands-on learning, without the risks or costs associated
      with traditional labs. The goal was simple; make a virtual lab that fully
      captured the fun that she experienced in her school labs, and that could
      be used by anyone, anywhere, at any time.

      The journey began modestly with a rudimentary lab mockup that served to
      test initial coding ideas. Right from the start the dream of a unified
      virtual lab was clear, but the path to realizing it was less so. With
      academic simulations as a foundation, the first lab iteration was a simple
      prototype that laid the groundwork to test ideas and refine the vision.
      However, as most academic simulations use supercomputers, and take months
      to run (

      >

      ), the challenge was to make the simulations run in real-time on a bespoke
      VR platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the work was done to refine these equations down to run in real
      time, while still producing realistic results. The first lab was purely a
      proof of concept, showing that the simulations could be run in real time,
      and that they could be interacted with in a meaningful way. Studies in
      computational physics education highlight the importance of real-time
      interaction for conceptual understanding, as immediate feedback helps
      students connect theoretical concepts with observable phenomena (

      ).
    </p>
    <p>
      Around this time Whimsylabs caught the attention of the University of
      Edinburgh due to our breakthrough work in simuations and ambitious impact
      driven goals, securing places in their prestigious incubator programs and
      going on to win the Summer Accelerator. From these victories and
      recognitions, we were able to secure our first bout of funding to build a
      bespoke VR/web combo platform, and bring on our second founder to help
      build the lab; a Chemist PhD with years of experience in education and
      training for the chemical industry.

    <p>
      The second lab was built to see how we could make the lab feel more like a
      real lab, and less like a video game. This was first time we had to
      consider how the lab would be used in a real educational setting to teach
      the motions and actions of a lab. This phenomenology of the lab revealed
      itself to be crucial for students to begin to build the muscle memory
      needed to perform these procedures in real life, with things like liquid
      physics and realistic physical interactions needed to capture feeling of
      being in a lab. Research in embodied cognition demonstrates that physical
      movements and gestures significantly enhance learning and retention in
      scientific contexts (

      ).
    </p>
    <p>
      The second lab was a success, and we were able to reach out to schools to
      test the lab in a real educational setting. The feedback was
      overwhelmingly positive, with students and teachers alike praising the lab
      for its realism and ease of use. This was a critical step in the
      development of the lab, as it showed that the lab could be used in a real
      educational setting, and that it could be a valuable tool for teaching and
      learning. There was just one issue: the lab was ugly.

      The final lab: A blend of cutting-edge technology and an inviting design
      that stands out.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this in mind, we set out to completely redesign the lab from scratch.
      However, due to the limited power of VR headsets and the processing cost
      of the advanced simulations, there was little room to reflect high
      fidelity realism. Another consideration was the broad range of ages that
      would be using the lab, from 5 to 18+, and the need to make the lab
      accessible to all of them. The choice of direction was difficult, but in
      the end we were guided by one of our original desires that the lab is a
      place of wonder and exploration, and that it should be a place that
      students want to come back to. Research in educational psychology
      emphasizes the importance of intrinsic motivation and curiosity-driven
      learning in STEM education (
      <a

      ). It was around this time where we settled on our Whimsycat as our logo
      and mascot, an icon unlike any other in the virtual lab space,
      encapsulating the curiosity and wonder that we wanted to inspire in our
      students.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final lab design was a blend of cutting-edge technology and an
      inviting design that stands out in the crowded edtech space. This lab, our
      current flagship lab was now a fully realized virtual environment that
      offered a wide range of experiments and simulations, across Chemistry,
      Physics and Biology. Using this lab we were able to enter the prestigious
      Converge Challenge, a competition for the best new businesses in Scotland,
      and secure a place in the final under the Create Change category, where we
      placed Second out of all business in Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through our victory at Converge, we secured the funds to attend BETT UK
      and take our innovations to a global stage. The feedback from students and
      educators alike was overwhelmingly positive, with many highlighting how
      the platform transforms STEM education. Additionally, Whimsylabs'
      innovative approach had not gone unnoticed. The platform was recognized by
      the Epping Forest Schools Partnership Trust as part of the Kids Judge
      Bett, where pupils nominated Whimsylabs for their use of virtual labs to
      teach students about laboratory environments, while also providing a
      powerful tool for sustainability. This acknowledgment highlights the power
      in our mission to inspire the next generation of STEM leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Whimsylabs has been quietly developing its technology for the past
      few years, only whispered amongst a few piloting schools, we are now ready
      to make noise and be loud about our groundbreaking solution. With a strong
      foundation, a growing team, and a proven track record of innovation,
      Whimsylabs is poised to transform science education and inspire the next
      generation of STEM leaders while staying true to our core values. To
      provide a sandbox laboratory that captures the physicality of performing
      labs, to capture the fun and wonder of science, and to make science
      accessible and affordable to all.
