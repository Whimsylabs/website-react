# WhimsyLabs Website - AI Instruction Guide

## Project Overview
This is a React-based website for WhimsyLabs, a company that provides virtual laboratory simulations for educational purposes. The website is deployed on GitHub Pages and showcases the company's products, services, and blog.

## Development Guidelines

1. **File Size Limit**: Keep all files under 500 lines of code whenever possible.
2. **Component Separation**: Split functionality into separate files as much as possible to maintain clean code organization.
3. **React Architecture**: This is a React application using React Router for navigation.
4. **Continuous Documentation**: This instruction file should be updated as the codebase evolves.

## Project Structure

### Core Files
- `package.json`: Contains project dependencies and scripts
- `src/index.js`: Entry point of the application
- `src/App.js`: Main application component with routing setup
- `public/index.html`: HTML template with meta tags and fallback handling

### Main Components
- `MainContent.js`: Homepage content container that assembles various sections
- `Header.js`: Navigation header with links to different pages
- `Footer.js`: Site footer with links and social media icons
- `Blog.js`: Blog page that dynamically imports posts from the blog directory

### Feature Components
- `WelcomeSection.js`: Landing section with animated wave text effect
- `FeaturesSection.js`: Showcases product features in a three-column layout
- `SplashSection.js`: Section with wave animation backgrounds for visual separation

### Blog System
- `blog/Post1.js`, `blog/Post2.js`, etc.: Individual blog posts as separate components
- Posts are dynamically imported in the Blog component
- Each post exports title, date, slug, description, and content

### Styling
- Each component has its own CSS file (e.g., `Header.css`, `Footer.css`)
- Component-specific styles are scoped to their respective components
- Global styles are defined in `App.css` and `index.css`
- Responsive design is implemented using media queries
- Animation effects are implemented using CSS keyframes

## Styling Architecture

### Color Palette
- Primary Background: #dabeff (lavender)
- Secondary Background: #95CEF6 (light blue)
- Dark Background: #1f1968 (deep purple)
- Accent Colors: #6172B3, #14b7ff
- Text Colors: #333333 (dark gray), #ffffff (white)

### Animation Types
1. **Wave Text Animation**: Letters move up and down in sequence (WelcomeSection)
2. **Bubble Animation**: Bubbles rise from bottom to top with random paths (BubbleContainer)
3. **Wave Background**: Animated wave shapes for section dividers (SplashSection)
4. **Fade Transitions**: Content fades in/out during transitions (Testimonial)
5. **Rise Up Animation**: Elements rise into view when scrolled to (Feature)

### CSS Techniques
- Flexbox for layout structure
- CSS Grid for partner logos
- CSS Variables for consistent theming
- Media queries for responsive design

## Component Dependencies
- `MainContent.js` depends on multiple components including WelcomeSection, FeaturesSection, etc.
- `Blog.js` dynamically imports blog posts from the `blog` directory
- `Header.js` and `Footer.js` are used across multiple page components
- `BubbleContainer.js` is a wrapper component used in multiple sections

## Development Workflow
1. Make changes to components in the `src/Components` directory
2. Test locally using `npm start`
3. Build for production using `npm run build`
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages using `npm run deploy`

## GitHub Pages Deployment
The website is configured to be deployed on GitHub Pages:
1. The `homepage` field in package.json is set to "https://whimsylabs.ai"
2. The deployment process uses the `gh-pages` package (listed in devDependencies)
3. The deployment workflow is:
   - `npm run predeploy`: Automatically runs before deploy, executes `npm run build`
   - `npm run build`: Builds the React app and then runs the static HTML generator
   - `npm run postbuild`: Runs `generate-html-pages.js` to create static HTML files for each route
   - `npm run deploy`: Runs `gh-pages -d build` to publish the build folder to GitHub Pages
4. A CNAME file in the root directory ensures the custom domain (whimsylabs.ai) is maintained

## Multi-Page Application Structure
The website uses a hybrid approach that combines React with static HTML generation:

1. **Static HTML Files**:
   - Each main route (`/`, `/blog`, `/services`, `/features`) has its own HTML file
   - The `generate-html-pages.js` script creates these files during the build process
   - This allows direct access to URLs like https://whimsylabs.ai/blog

2. **React Integration**:
   - Each static HTML file includes a script that sets the initial route for React Router
   - The App component accepts an `initialPath` prop to render the correct content
   - After initial load, client-side routing takes over for navigation

3. **404 Handling**:
   - The `404.html` file checks if the requested path is valid
   - If valid, it redirects to the appropriate static HTML file
   - If invalid, it shows a 404 error page

4. **Asset Management**:
   - Static assets are copied to each route's directory
   - This ensures resources are available regardless of the entry point

For more details on how this works, see the `MPA-CONVERSION.md` file.

## Future Maintenance Notes
- When adding new blog posts, create them in the `src/Components/blog` directory following the existing pattern
- When adding new features, consider creating new components to maintain the separation of concerns
- When modifying styles, keep component-specific styles in their respective CSS files
- Update this instruction file when making significant changes to the codebase structure

## Adding New Blog Posts
To add a new blog post to the website:

1. **Create a New Post File**:
   Create a new file in the `src/Components/blog` directory, following the naming pattern (e.g., `Post3.js`):

   ```javascript
   // src/Components/blog/Post3.js
   import React from "react";
   // Images are now served from public directory, use direct paths like:
   // <img src="/images/sample-image.png" alt="Description" />
   
   export const title = "Your Blog Post Title";
   export const date = "YYYY-MM-DD"; // Format: 2025-03-15
   export const slug = "your-blog-post-slug";
   export const description = "A brief description of your blog post for SEO and previews.";
   
   export const content = (
     <div>
       <p>
         Your blog post content goes here. You can use regular HTML elements within this JSX.
       </p>
       <img src={sampleImage} alt="Description of image" className="rounded shadow center limited-size" />
       <p className="caption">Caption for the image above.</p>
       <p>
         More paragraphs of content...
       </p>
     </div>
   );
   ```

2. **Style Guidelines for Blog Posts**:
   - Use the `rounded`, `shadow`, `center`, and `limited-size` classes for images
   - Add captions with the `caption` class
   - Keep paragraphs short and readable
   - Use proper heading hierarchy if needed (h2, h3, etc.)
   - Include links to relevant content where appropriate

3. **Image Optimization**:
   - Optimize images before adding them to the `src/Components/images` directory
   - Use descriptive file names for images
   - Provide meaningful alt text for accessibility

4. **Testing**:
   - After adding the new post, test the blog page to ensure it appears in the list
   - Check that the post is properly displayed when selected
   - Verify that the navigation between posts works correctly

The blog system will automatically import and display the new post in the blog page, sorted by date (newest first).

## Adding New Pages
To add a new page to the website:

1. **Create the Page Component**:
   ```javascript
   // src/Components/NewPage.js
   import React from 'react';
   import Header from './Header';
   import Footer from './Footer';
   import './NewPage.css'; // Create this file for page-specific styles
   
   const NewPage = () => {
     return (
       <main className="container-fluid text-center p-0">
         <Header />
         {/* Page content goes here */}
         <Footer />
       </main>
     );
   };
   
   export default NewPage;
   ```

2. **Add the Route in App.js**:
   ```javascript
   // In src/App.js
   import NewPage from "./Components/NewPage";
   
   // Inside the Routes component
   <Route path="/new-page" element={<NewPage />} />
   <Route path="/new-page/*" element={<Navigate to="/new-page" />} />
   ```

3. **Add Navigation Link in Header.js**:
   ```javascript
   // In src/Components/Header.js, add to the nav items
   <li className="nav-item">
     <Link to="/new-page" className={`nav-link ${location.pathname === '/new-page' ? 'active' : ''}`}>
       New Page
     </Link>
   </li>
   ```

4. **Add Link in Footer.js** (if needed):
   ```javascript
   // In src/Components/Footer.js, add to the footer links
   <li><Link to="/new-page" className="nav-link">New Page</Link></li>
   ```

5. **Create Page-Specific Styles**:
   ```css
   /* src/Components/NewPage.css */
   .new-page-specific-class {
     /* Styles for the new page */
   }
   ```

6. **Update SEO Meta Tags** in the new page component:
   ```javascript
   // Inside your new page component
   import { Helmet } from 'react-helmet-async';
   
   // Inside the return statement
   <>
     <Helmet>
       <title>New Page Title | WhimsyLabs</title>
       <meta name="description" content="Description of the new page" />
       {/* Additional meta tags as needed */}
     </Helmet>
     {/* Rest of the component */}
   </>
   ```

7. **Add the Page to the Static HTML Generator**:
   ```javascript
   // In generate-html-pages.js, add to the routes array
   const routes = [
     // Existing routes...
     { 
       path: '/new-page', 
       outputFile: 'new-page/index.html', 
       title: "New Page Title | WhimsyLabs", 
       description: "Description of the new page" 
     }
   ];
   ```

8. **Update the 404.html Page**:
   ```javascript
   // In public/404.html, add to the validPaths array
   var validPaths = ["/", "/blog", "/services", "/features", "/new-page"];
   ```

## Best Practices for Code Maintenance
1. **Component Organization**:
   - Keep components under 500 lines of code
   - Split large components into smaller, focused components
   - Group related components in subdirectories

2. **CSS Management**:
   - Maintain component-specific styles in dedicated CSS files
   - Use consistent naming conventions for CSS classes
   - Consider using CSS variables for shared values

3. **Image Optimization**:
   - Use WebP format for images when possible
   - Compress images before adding to the project
   - Provide appropriate width/height attributes to prevent layout shifts

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Lazy load components that aren't needed on initial render
   - Optimize animations for performance
   - Consider code splitting for larger feature sets

## Potential Future Enhancements
1. **State Management**:
   - Consider implementing Redux or Context API for more complex state management if the app grows
   - Implement local storage for persisting user preferences

2. **Testing Implementation**:
   - Add unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library
   - Implement end-to-end tests with Cypress

3. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Add a contact form instead of mailto link
   - Implement a newsletter subscription feature
   - Add more interactive elements to showcase the virtual lab capabilities
   - Create a demo section with embedded interactive examples

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement code splitting with React.lazy()
   - Add service worker for offline capabilities
   - Optimize image loading with lazy loading

## Key React Patterns Used
- Functional components with React hooks
- Component composition for reusability
- Dynamic content loading (for blog posts)
- Conditional rendering based on state
- CSS-in-JS for component styling
- Intersection Observer API for scroll animations

## Accessibility and SEO Considerations
### Accessibility Features
- ARIA attributes used throughout components (aria-label, aria-labelledby, etc.)
- Semantic HTML elements (header, footer, section, etc.)
- Proper focus management for interactive elements
- Color contrast considerations in the design
- Screen reader friendly content structure

### SEO Implementation
- Meta tags managed through React Helmet/Helmet Async
- Custom page titles and descriptions for different routes
- Open Graph tags for social media sharing
- Twitter Card metadata for Twitter sharing
- Bluesky Card metadata for Bluesky sharing
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, etc.)
- Descriptive alt text for images
